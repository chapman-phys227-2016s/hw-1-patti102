# PHYS227 HW 1

**Author:** Taylor Patti

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-1-patti102.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-1-patti102)

**Due date:** 2016/02/09

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise 3.8 (```adaptive_trapezint.py```)
1. Exercise 3.15 (```sinesum1.py```)
1. Exercise 3.18 (```centered_diff.py```)
1. Exercise 3.34 (```find_primes.py```)

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw1.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

These were fun excercises. It was the perfect amount of work for me to be able to solve every problem both as elegantly and as possible while in the most sophisticated way that I could. I think that this is the appropriate amount of homework for a week of class.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

I looked up the meaning of a few error messages, but didn't pay attention to their solutions (they probably didn't really apply to my particular code anyways). I also used the syntax given in the book.

Signed,

Taylor Patti
